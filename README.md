# GraphingCalculator
a powerful graphic calculator for plotting functions. supports various mathematical functions, derivatives, variables, points, lines, and more

## Syntax
here are some examples of valid syntax:
`x`
`x+3`
`7*sin(x)`
`a=8`
`x+a*x`
`a=[1,10]` (creates a slider which can then be used to change a between 1-10)
`f(x)=x^4-cos(2*x)` (defines function f(x) which can then be used)
`g(x)=x+f(x)`
`f'(x)` (the derivative of f)
`(3,4)` (point at (3,4))
`[1,2,3,4]` (line from (1,2) to (3,4))
